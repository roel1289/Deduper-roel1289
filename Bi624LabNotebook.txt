Creating Deduper functions
Manipulated test.sam file by copying last line and adding an S into Cigar string

Had troubles with "pass", so we used continue
While True loop didn't want to work, so we used a for loop

For the cigar string, we will add the number before S (soft clipping) to the start position

going to use a set that contains tuples. Will check to see if tuple is in the set and then will add if not


```cat out.sam | awk '{if ($3 == 1){print}}' | wc -l```

```
#!/bin/bash


for i in {1..19}
do 
    echo "chrom"$i
    cat out.sam | awk -v var="$i" '{if ($3 == var){print}}' | wc -l
done

exit
```
