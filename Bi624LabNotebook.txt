# Labnotebook for Bi624

Creating Deduper functions
Manipulated test.sam file by copying last line and adding an S into Cigar string

Had troubles with "pass", so we used continue
While True loop didn't want to work, so we used a for loop

For the cigar string, we will add the number before S (soft clipping) to the start position
